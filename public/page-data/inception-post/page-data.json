I taught few around me about JS and React but I believe there are still more people who need guidance in approaching new technologies. That gives birth to this blog.</p>\n<p>I always wanted to have a blog but it took me this much time to get the ball rolling due to my busy schedule (or I’m too lazy to get started :p) Anyways finally its here. From now on, whatever I learn, be it a small concept like arrow function or more complex concepts like closures or prototypes, I’m going to share with you.</p>\n<p>(Shhh… I’m going to share with only you. Yeah! Only you. Not to everyone. Lucky you! ;))</p>\n<p>If you would like to read an article on some topic or if you would like to send me some feedback/love, feel free to drop a message to <a href=\"mailto:ambatikirankumar4@gmail.com\">me</a> !
